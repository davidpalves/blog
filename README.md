# davidpalves blog

This is a blog created with [Swyxkit](https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit), and heavily inspired by [Luciano Ratamero's personal blog](https://www.ratamero.com/)

## How it works?
You can check Ratamero's [blogpost](https://www.ratamero.com/blog/this-post-was-written-in-obsidian) about his approach 
to the modifications he made in this blog.

However, in a few words, I'd say that this blog uses svelte engine to read markdown files
located in the directory `blog/src/posts` and in the `blog/src/posts/notes` and renders them as pages.

The original Swyxkit project uses github issues with the label `[Published]`  and comments within this issue.
The approach of using markdown files within the project itself is simpler and faster to write - in my opinion. 
However it is a little more of hassle when dealing with images, since github allows us to simply paste images and it's done.

I may experiment with swyxkit's original solution or anything else that comes to mind later, 
hence the reason of creating this blog: learning and tweaking with different things.
